# ImpHack Revised
Official client of the 2b2t Imperials.

ImpHack is a client that runs off Minecraft Forge 1.12.2, it is intended for use on servers which allow client-side modification. 
ImpHack takes no inspiration from any previous clients. It is completely original and no skidding was done.
Skidders can rot in a hole and die!

## To get started:
This client runs on forge 1.12.2

The prefix of the client is "." (Period) 



There is no initial keybind for the click gui so in order to bind the clickgui to a key you need to type ".bind set clickgui keyname"

### How to Build

`gradlew setupdecompworkspace`

`gradlew clean`

`gradlew build`
